# Diamonds Price Regression Project

## Brief Description 
The dataset for this project contains attributes and prices of around 54,000 diamonds. 

**Objectives:**
* Perform an Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA).
* Create a machine learning model to predict the diamond prices. 

**Regression models used:** Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, Lasso, and CatBoost. 

**The ten features and target are:** 
* Weight: weight of the diamond.
* Length (x): length of the diamond.
* Width (y): width of the diamond
* Depth (z): depth of the diamond.
* %Depth: depth percentage. Formula: z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y)
* Table: width of top of the diamond relative to the widest point.
* Quality: quality of the diamond. Possible values (from best to worst): ideal, premium, very good, good, fair.
* Color: color of the diamond. Possible values: from D (best) to J (worst).
* Clarity: measurement of how clear the diamond is. Possible values (from best to worst): IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1.
* Price (target): price of the diamond in US dollars.
